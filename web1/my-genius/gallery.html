        <h2>There are a variety of different ways to shoot a basketball. Over the years, we have seen a range of
            fundamentally sound and unorthodox shots in the NBA (National Basketball Association).</h2>

        <h2>What is Stephen Curry (on the right) good at?</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>He places the ball in the center relative to his
                shoulders</li>
            <li>He does a good job of maximizing his power by using his legs more than his arms</li>
            <li>He has a perfect shot</li>

        </ul>
        <h2>Larry Bird (top left) played in the 1980s</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>His shot was rather unorthodox as he placed the ball behind his head</li>
            <li>Do not shoot like he does, unless not following the fundamentals works for you</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Klay Thompson (bottom) is a current player</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Klay specializes in catch-and-shoot shots, where he gets passed the ball and shoots it within a second
                or so</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Here are some other players I enjoy watching:</h2>
        <img style="width: 500 px; height: 700px;" src="images/ray.jpg.crdownload" alt="Ray Allen shooting">
        <p>Ray Allen (above) was famous for his athleticism, and his catch-and-shoot three-point shooting</p>
        <h2>My favorite player to watch is Devin Booker (below)</h2>
        <img style="width: 400px ; height: 300px" src="images/devin.jfif" alt="Devin Booker Shooting">
        <p>Devin is good at mid-range shots, which are shots closer to the basket than three-pointers</p>
