    <h2>I started playing basketball when I was 4. My dad taught me how to shoot, and I immediately picked up the game
        and enjoyed it. I've always appreciated the challenge, and the mental strength required to play the sport. I
        think basketball reflects life in many ways, in terms of challenge, and the highs and lows of the sport</h2>
