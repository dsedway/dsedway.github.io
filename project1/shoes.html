                        <p>LeBron James is an iconic figure in basketball. His most recent shoes are said to be one of
                            the best performers of all time. They are stylish as well, and very popular amongst teens
                            and NBA players.</p>

                        <p>These are my personal pair of basketball shoes. If you read my thoughts on basketball shoes
                            below, you'll know I want to be comfortable and capable on the court. These shoes are
                            lightweight, grippy, and very comfortable. I also love the purple. </p>

                        <h1>My thoughts on basketball shoes</h1>
                        <p>I have been playing basketball since I was 4. I have always loved the culture and the
                            obsession
                            around vintage and current basketball shoes. Every basketball shoe needs to have 3 key
                            components in order to be a good or great shoe. First, it has to have good cushion. The Air
                            Jordan 1s, seen <a href="index.html">here</a> had great traction, so they would stick to the
                            ground, but the cushion was terrible. Michael Jordan said that his feet would bleed in them
                            due
                            to the sole feeling like cardboard. A great basketball shoe must have great traction. Like I
                            previously mentioned, a basketball shoe needs to stick to the ground. If I'm slipping, I can
                            get
                            injured and be slow on the court. Last, but not least, a basketball shoe needs to look good.
                            A
                            distracting and absurd silhouette for a shoe frustrates buyers and wearers. Good performing
                            basketball shoes usually look good. A clean and simple design indicates a great shoe. </p>
